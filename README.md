# Rule-Based Chatbot Project

## Project Overview
This rule-based chatbot is designed to simulate conversation with users based on a predefined set of rules. The bot responds to user inputs by matching them to the most relevant predefined answer. This project is implemented in Python and is ideal for understanding the basics of chatbot development without complex machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- **Rule-Based Matching:** Uses a simple rule engine to match user inputs with predefined responses.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more rules and responses.
- **Logging**: Captures user inputs and bot responses for further analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Additional Python libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`
